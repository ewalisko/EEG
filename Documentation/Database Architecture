Goal:
	Create human machine interface that aims to optimize possitive affective states through behavior modification suggestions.

Method:
	1. System takes in data source.
	2. Correlations are discovered between which contexts result in 	negative affective states and which result in possitive.
	3. Implement realtime notification systems that warn user if 		they are participating in contexts that will result in 			negative affective states.

Data Sets:
	1. Time
	2. Affective(electrodermal, brain activity, etc)
		a. potential for a human user input section.

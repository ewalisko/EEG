Goal:
* Create human machine interface that aims to optimize possitive affective states through behavior modification suggestions.

Method:
	1. System takes in data source.
	2. Correlations are discovered between which contexts result in negative affective states and which result in possitive.
	3. Implement realtime notification systems that warn user if they are participating in contexts that will result in negative affective states.
	4. Continuously improve and reevaluate the correlation algorithm based on new data as well as user input

Data Sets:
	1. Time
	2. Affective(electrodermal, brain activity, etc)
		1. potential for a human user input section.
	3. Context (picture, location, human activity, etc)
